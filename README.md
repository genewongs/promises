# promises

In this project, I learned the ins and outs of promises. I utilized different types of technologies to experiment with promises including bluebird, async await, fetch, and promisify.

One bigger challenge I faced was learning how and recognizing when to use Promise.all() to resolve an array of promises.

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
